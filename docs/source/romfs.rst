How do I obtain these folders?
-----------------------------------------------------
After you dump the games files you will see it's contents split into these two folders. (Link to setup/dumping guide here)

```javascript
console.log("ROMFS means Rom Filesystem while EXEFS means Executable Filesystem they are split up due to their vast differences in what their jobs are.
To explain this I will be using Pizza!")
```
